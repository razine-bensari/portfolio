I am a software engineering student (final year), working with Java mainly and playing with Go. I love backend, writing SAAS, using cloud technologies and discrete math.
The topics in software engineering I am the most passionate about is Software Architecture and Software design (i.e. beautiful code).
I am currently taking graduate classes at Concordia University in Artifical Inteligence because this domain brings the gap between great fields in mathematics and programing
I took the following classes:

1. **COMP 473/6731: Pattern Recognition**
2. **COMP 472/6721: Artifical Intelligence**
3. **COMP 432/6321: Machine Learning (Fall 2020)**

Other than that. I adore eating and discovering culinary specialities of various countries all around the world.
I am always up for a soccer/football pick up game, I love attending hackathons and I am an avid reader on topics surrounding mathematics.

Thanks for reading!
